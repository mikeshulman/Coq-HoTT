The files in this directory develop the theory of "internal"
reflective subcategories, and stable factorization systems, in the
category of types.  The files go in the following order:

- ReflectiveSubfibration.v
- StableFactorizationSystem.v
- LexReflectiveSubcategory.v

The file EpiMono.v gives an example: the epi-mono factorization
system, corresponding to the reflective subcategory of propositions.
(This example requires the higher inductive type is_inhab from the HIT
directory.)

Unfortunately, these files result in universe inconsistencies when
using plain Coq 8.3; so compiling them requires the Type-in-Type
patch, available at
