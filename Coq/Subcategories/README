The files in this directory develop the theory of "internal"
reflective subcategories, and stable factorization systems, in the
category of types.  The files go in the following order, each adding
new axioms to the previous ones.

- ReflectiveSubfibration.v
- StableFactorizationSystem.v
- LexReflectiveSubcategory.v

The following files prove additional properties:

- LocalSubfibration.v: Any reflective subfibration is local (i.e. a stack).

The following files give examples.

- EpiMono.v: the (effective-epi,mono) stable factorization system,
  corresponding to the reflective subcategory of propositions.
  (Requires the HIT is_inhab.)
- OpenSubtopos.v: Any proposition (=subterminal object) U determines
  an open subtopos.

Unfortunately, these files result in universe inconsistencies when
using plain Coq 8.3; so compiling them requires the Type-in-Type
patch, available at
