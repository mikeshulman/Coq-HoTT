(** The following tactic often allows us to "pretend" that pointed maps and homotopies preserve basepoints strictly.

  (** TODO: [pointed_reduce] uses [rewrite], and thus according to our current general rules, it should only be used in opaque proofs.  We don't yet need any of the proofs that use it to be transparent, but there's a good chance we will eventually.  At that point we can consider whether to allow it in transparent proofs, modify it to not use [rewrite], or exclude it from proofs that need to be transparent. *)
